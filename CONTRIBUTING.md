# How to Contribute to this Project

If you have a feature you'd like to see, or knowhow to fix a specific bug, then maybe you'd like to contribute code to this project.  Please follow the steps below to ease the process of including your code in the main repository and master branch.

## Step 1: Fork this repo

We use the fork strategy to help isolate changes.  Anyone can create a fork of this repository.

## Step 2: Write some code

Get to hackin'.  We use commitizen for commit messages, although you don't need to worry too much about these because we will manually merge your branch.

## Step 3: Issue a Pull Request

Submit a pull request for your fork to the master branch of the main repository.  Your pull request will be reviewed by any active maintainers (right now, just Drew) and tested in isolation.

To assist in the process of code review, please include the following:

 - **If your code fixes a bug**: Include steps necessary to reproduce the bug, or a link to an issue that contains the same.  A short explanation of how your code solves the bug would also be appreciated if it's a non-obvious bug.

 - **If your code adds a feature**: Include a short use case for this feature, or a quick explanation of how this feature improves BootSwatchr.  **Feature additions will NOT be judged on the merit of their justification**.  We simply use this as a means to determine duplicate functionality, potential future issues / maintenance, and identify similar on-going work.  If available, please include links to posts, issues, gifs, tweets, instagrams, vines, or videos about the feature, or it's proposal, in the pull request comments.  Seriously, if you have shown it off, we'd love to know about it.

## Regarding Feature Branches

We don't use feature branches because we achieve feature isolation with forking.  That said, you are free to use feature branches in your forks, but your pull request should still target master in the main repo.  We may choose to use feature branches in the future, but for the time being, they are not required.
